# R-regression-basics-tutorial
- Regression analysis and modeling by R launguage is really fun.
- This repository have only data analysis and regression modeling for 1 dataset 'prestige'. The dataset is quite small. **But even with this small data, you can analyze/model in various ways. That's the fun.**
- **The analysis and modeling covered here** is (just example):
  - **data exploration** by Cleaveland dotplot and correlations.
  - **data transformation**
  - **ordinary linear regression**
  - **model diagnostics**
    - default plot
    - assess residuals
    - confidence interval
    - main effect plot
  - **model update**
    - model interactions
    - identify influential data by various method
    - variable selection (exhaustive and stepwise)
  - **model comparison**
  - **model understanding**
    - conditional effect plot
    - full model plot
  - **robust regression**
  - **multimodel inference**
- This is just ordinary linear regression (with some tweaks). **If you would like to try more**, here would help:
